## Introduction

This project build based ib Unreal Engine 5.3 to create a Top-Down voxel RPG game. It draws inspiration from Minecraft, such
as its inventory system and artistic style, as well as the Top-Down perspective, combat system, and isometric indoor
scene design of the game Minecraft: Dungeon. CharmingCraft aims to offer a more relaxed gameplay experience, where
players can freely explore the map, gather resources to craft weapons, complete quests, and more...

## Build

Use the `vc solution file` and the `Unreal 5.3.1 Engine source code` and `uproject file` to build. All dependency is on
this repository.

## Feature

### Inventory system (Reformated version)

![Inventory System](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/fc5dc7c2-f917-46b6-8202-8f1a388e62ed)

- **Quick hotbar** allow player siwtch different modes (**`Z` battle**, **`X` Inventory hotbar**, **`C` Building**, **`V` Team**)
- The complete inventory system includes **merging** items, **using** items, **drop** items, **transferring** items, and more.
- **Detailed item pannel** show item attributes and large preview.
- Quickly close and open container, support player open inventory when moving.
- **Auto open player inventory** when open any container, close both pannel when player inventory is opened by container not by player. (else close only container)
- 10 Equipment slot with **equip model binding**.

### Build system
![Build System](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/25aab4d0-cb80-47e3-b726-656243074b34)
- When switching game modes, automatically load **ContextMapping layouts** according to the mode to prevent key conflicts.
- Supports building, rotation (using `Q` and `E` keys), build specification preview, collision highlighting, destruction, and other functions (press `F` to switch between **Build** / **Destroy** mode).
- In build mode, automatically disable the interaction between players and interactive objects.
- Supports **filters** that only allow building in appropriate areas, such as preventing players from building in mining areas.

### Chunk System (Refactory of Biome Actor)
![chunk-system](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/cf80141b-1730-4815-9a3b-e701ed820743)
- The Chunk system allows the game map to be divided into several cubes of the size 10 x 10 x 10. A single Chunk **can be activated as needed**, conserving system resources.

- A single Chunk Tile calculates the grid it occupies in the [**Construction Script**](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/blob/afe8917e7482ab9eae9adc91169e57414c760a2b/Source/CharmingCraft/Core/Resource/Chunk/LandChunk.cpp#L44) based on the chunk's size **(snapped to 100)**. These grid points **(Blue in graph)**, stored inside the Chunk, play a significant role in resource generation.

- The Chunk system has **integrated** the previously **Biome box area Actors**. Now, it's only necessary to allocate Biome data within a single Chunk, **eliminating the need to create Biome boxes** and adjust their sizes. After adjusting the Biome and world resource data, the Chunk will randomly generate resources upon activation.

- Because a Chunk records all the grid points it occupies upon creation, these snap-to-grid points can be easily used for ray tracing.

<p align="center">
The new version of the Chunk system integrates the Biome Box Actor to manage and generate natural resources in Chunk units.
</p>

#### Resource Collision Enhance

- To avoid resource collisions or parts being suspended in air within a Chunk, the four corners of the bottom face of the box are used for **pre-generation** judgment.

- First, a point is randomly selected from the **GridPoints pre-stored in the Chunk** for pre-generation.

- The [**four corner coordinates**](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/blob/afe8917e7482ab9eae9adc91169e57414c760a2b/Source/CharmingCraft/Core/Resource/Lib/GenerateTraceLibrary.h#L24) of the bottom face of the resource Actor's HitBox are used as starting points for ray tracing downwards. If the Z values of the HitResult's return are the same, it can preliminarily be judged as a plane.

- If the randomly selected point for ray tracing is not obstructed or is the expected terrain, then the Resource Actor can be generated.

### Farming System
![farming-cycle](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/00ff9f88-be3f-4257-9f8b-b97010b74b1f)

- The farming system, in conjunction with the **resource gathering system** and **Chunk system**, allows players to find crop seeds for planting within naturally generated brush.
- However, before planting, players need to use a hoe to dig and till the land. The hoe uses the building system's **construction indicator** to inform players whether the current grid is valid.
- The growth rate of each crop depends on the current soil medium. Different crops have different **growth cycles** and **stage texture models**. Players can also configure the drops of crops at different stages (In the future, crop growth timers will count in "game days" rather than seconds).
- Each crop has its own health. When the health reaches zero, the crop drops items. Different weapons and tools cause different damage to crops (for example, the hoe has higher agricultural damage).

### Item Action/Ability System
![item-ability-system](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/43ddbacc-668a-4737-b4cf-48f2a8147882)

The Item Ability System is an expansion and decoupling based on the **Game Ability System (GAS)**, allowing items and equipment in the game to have skill effects. The types of item skills include `USE`, `SHIFT`, `SHIFT_INTERACT`, `RIGHT_CLICK`, `HOTBAR_CAST`, `INTERACT`, `PASSIVE`, `ON_HIT`, `ON_ATTACK`, with specific keys and game events triggering the above skill callbacks.

- An item can have multiple skills of different types, but only one skill per type can be activated. For example, a bow can have four types of right-click shooting skills, but the player can only activate one. The same applies to other types of skills.
- If the player's inventory contains skills of the same type, they are executed in **priority order**.
- The skill selected and activated by the player is stored in the **ItemMeta**. The number and type of activatable skills in an item are based on the **initial set of skills** + **material skills** of the item + **special skills** (level, talents, profession, etc.).
- When a player equips an item, the skills within the item are loaded into the Action Components and are unloaded from the Action Components upon unequipping.

### Equipment assembly

https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/aa4a85df-a49b-488b-8887-5868ce0d31ec

- Just like how people make weapons, you can use any material to create different weapon parts and assemble them
  together

### Smart enemy AI

https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/5bc09e55-ef8d-457f-99bc-cf73020b48cf

- Many enemies will interact with the scene and they will use their best advantage to try to defeat you
- Current enemies: Slime, Skeleton, Skeleton Shaman

### Flexible action system

https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/e0d9ac26-1a67-4d21-806d-84155a471d44

- Although it is a TopDown perspective game, you can click on the target to attack or hold down shift to attack to
  specify the click direction.
- Different weapons have different attack animations, and the speed of these attack animations depends on your character
  and equipment attributes.

### Scene switching

https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/eda346ab-ff80-4fdc-a8c1-e8a36b4b55ba

- When you walk into the room from the outside, the scene switching will be smooth and stylized.

### GAS, Buff and RPG elements

- Use the chain of responsibility design pattern to handle multiple types of damage. The damage is packaged into HitData
  by struct.
- Use BuffInfo, BuffData, BuffHandler to callback BuffModels implement Buff System.
- Magic, arcane, and some weird stuff...

### Resource Gathering System

The Resource Gathering System enables players to collect various resources in the game by inheriting from [ResourceEntityActor](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/blob/main/Source/CharmingCraft/Core/Resource/Gather/ResourceEntityActor.h) to define resource entities that appear in the game. Additionally, the game's Biome system will refresh resources within a specified area over a period of time, ensuring a certain quantity is maintained. Structure See [here](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/blob/main/Page/resource-system-structure.md).

## Awaiting Improvement

- If the player cancels the interaction, ray tracing will still be performed, causing widespread resource actror damage.
- Fixing stuck and jittery issues when interacting with items on high ground (**Fixed**)
- Correct movement behind buildings when obstructed (Ray Tracing)
- Dynamic pathfinding improvements, refreshing available routes when players destroy blocks or interact with items (**Fixed**)
- Changing item dropping from generation to a throwing action
- Rendering 3D items into 2D images requires manual placement of RenderTargetActor in the world, otherwise it fails (**Fixed**)
- The `OnHit()` method of weapons is determined by the weapon type, consider passing in a weapon class template for the
  interaction component to execute the template class method for **HitData** transmission (**Fixed**)
- Combind ItemAbility System to part of Build Module, allow Ability data structure contained visual enhancement object.
