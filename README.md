## Introduction

This project utilizes Unreal Engine 5.3 to create a Top-Down voxel RPG game. It draws inspiration from Minecraft, such as its inventory system and artistic style, as well as the Top-Down perspective, combat system, and isometric indoor scene design of the game Minecraft: Dungeon. CharmingCraft aims to offer a more relaxed gameplay experience, where players can freely explore the map, gather resources to craft weapons, complete quests, and more...


## Build

Use the `vc solution file` and the `Unreal 5.3.1 Engine source code` and `uproject file` to build. All dependency is on
this repository.

## Feature

### Equipment assembly

- Just like how people make weapons, you can use any material to create different weapon parts and assemble them together

### Smart enemy AI

- Many enemies will interact with the scene and they will use their best advantage to try to defeat you
- Current enemies: Slime, Skeleton, Skeleton Shaman

### Flexible action system

- Although it is a TopDown perspective game, you can click on the target to attack or hold down shift to attack to specify the click direction.
- Different weapons have different attack animations, and the speed of these attack animations depends on your character and equipment attributes.

### Scene switching

- When you walk into the room from the outside, the scene switching will be smooth and stylized.

### Inventory system

- The complete inventory system includes merging items, using items, discarding items, transferring items, and more.

### RPG elements

- Use the chain of responsibility design pattern to handle multiple types of damage. The damage is packaged into HitData by struct.
- Magic, arcane, and some weird stuff...

## Progress

- Implementation of projectile blueprint templates based on C++
- Interactive interface and character interaction functionality
- Chest opening feature and animation implemented through the interactive interface
- Health bar decay implemented using event binding and UI parameter exposure
- Digital animations realized through the animation system
- Dynamic materials based on mathematical functions
- Implementation of chests and keys using GameTags
- Block skill (R key) implemented using GameTags
- Material highlight and glow upon impact
- Interactive item highlight and player obstruction glow
- Inventory system and item prototypes
- Armor forging station
- Rendering 3D items in 2D
- Item assembly mechanism, crafting items from different materials
- Weapon assembly, assembling different types and materials of parts for various weapon parts
- Attack animations and ranges based on different weapon types
- Dota-style mouse movement attack system, including character rotation and new stationary attacks
- Damage number animations based on player's attack direction
- Comprehensive AI system, including EQS, Behavior Trees, Decorators, and Services
- Scene transitions implemented using scene streaming


## Content and Mechanism

- [Attribute Multiplier and Damage Calculator](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/wiki/Attribute-Multiplier-and-Damage-Calculator)

## Coming Soon

- Complete attribute UI
- Game serialization and saving
- Refreshable areas: Respawn of monsters, resources, creatures
- Reset inventory UI and drag method
- Quest system with related NPCs and quest interfaces
- Developing an engaging storyline (currently no ideas)

## Awaiting Improvement

- Fixing stuck and jittery issues when interacting with items on high ground (**Fixed**)
- Correct movement behind buildings when obstructed (Ray Tracing)
- Dynamic pathfinding improvements, refreshing available routes when players destroy blocks or interact with items (**Fixed**)
- Changing item dropping from generation to a throwing action
- Rendering 3D items into 2D images requires manual placement of RenderTargetActor in the world, otherwise it fails (**Fixed**)
- The `OnHit()` method of weapons is determined by the weapon type, consider passing in a weapon class template for the interaction component to execute the template class method for **HitData** transmission (**Fixed**)
