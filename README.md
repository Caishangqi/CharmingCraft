## Introduction

This project utilizes Unreal Engine 5.3 to create a Top-Down voxel RPG game. It draws inspiration from Minecraft, such
as its inventory system and artistic style, as well as the Top-Down perspective, combat system, and isometric indoor
scene design of the game Minecraft: Dungeon. CharmingCraft aims to offer a more relaxed gameplay experience, where
players can freely explore the map, gather resources to craft weapons, complete quests, and more...

## Build

Use the `vc solution file` and the `Unreal 5.3.1 Engine source code` and `uproject file` to build. All dependency is on
this repository.

## Feature

### Inventory system (Reformated version)

![Inventory System](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/fc5dc7c2-f917-46b6-8202-8f1a388e62ed)

- Quick hotbar allow player siwtch different modes (**`Z`-battle**, **`X`-inventory hotbar**, **`C`-building**, **`V`-team**)
- The complete inventory system includes merging items, using items, discarding items, transferring items, and more.
- Detailed item pannel show item attributes and icon
- Quickly close and open container, support player open inventory when moving
- Auto open player inventory when open any container, close both pannel when player inventory is opened by container not by player. (else close only container)
- 10 Equipment slot with equip model binding.

### Equipment assembly

https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/aa4a85df-a49b-488b-8887-5868ce0d31ec

- Just like how people make weapons, you can use any material to create different weapon parts and assemble them
  together

### Smart enemy AI

https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/5bc09e55-ef8d-457f-99bc-cf73020b48cf

- Many enemies will interact with the scene and they will use their best advantage to try to defeat you
- Current enemies: Slime, Skeleton, Skeleton Shaman

### Flexible action system

https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/e0d9ac26-1a67-4d21-806d-84155a471d44

- Although it is a TopDown perspective game, you can click on the target to attack or hold down shift to attack to
  specify the click direction.
- Different weapons have different attack animations, and the speed of these attack animations depends on your character
  and equipment attributes.

### Scene switching

https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/assets/39553613/eda346ab-ff80-4fdc-a8c1-e8a36b4b55ba

- When you walk into the room from the outside, the scene switching will be smooth and stylized.

### GAS, Buff and RPG elements

- Use the chain of responsibility design pattern to handle multiple types of damage. The damage is packaged into HitData
  by struct.
- Use BuffInfo, BuffData, BuffHandler to callback BuffModels implement Buff System.
- Magic, arcane, and some weird stuff...

### Resource Gathering System

The Resource Gathering System enables players to collect various resources in the game by inheriting from [ResourceEntityActor](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/blob/main/Source/CharmingCraft/Core/Resource/Gather/ResourceEntityActor.h) to define resource entities that appear in the game. Additionally, the game's Biome system will refresh resources within a specified area over a period of time, ensuring a certain quantity is maintained. Structure See [here](https://github.com/Caishangqi/CharmingCraft/blob/main/Page/resource-system-structure.md).

## Awaiting Improvement

- Fixing stuck and jittery issues when interacting with items on high ground (**Fixed**)
- Correct movement behind buildings when obstructed (Ray Tracing)
- Dynamic pathfinding improvements, refreshing available routes when players destroy blocks or interact with items (**Fixed**)
- Changing item dropping from generation to a throwing action
- Rendering 3D items into 2D images requires manual placement of RenderTargetActor in the world, otherwise it fails (**Fixed**)
- The `OnHit()` method of weapons is determined by the weapon type, consider passing in a weapon class template for the
  interaction component to execute the template class method for **HitData** transmission (**Fixed**)
- Some User Widget component can create template for example, give all widget an close button that bind a function pointer.
